This file takes provided data related to UFO sightings in 2010 and generates it into a table on a webpage. There is also a filter option allowing the user to enter a date and generate table results that are specific to the date entered. However, I can't yet get the filtered data to appear in the table once cleared. I can get it to appear at the bottom of the table by removing the clear code.
